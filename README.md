- Hi, I’m @DaviStarlight, also known as just Davi
- I’m currently learning gaming development through the popular engine "Unreal", using the latest version.. I guess I consider myself a beginner indie developer, looking forward on improving my skills so I can put my creativity to fruition
- I also have interest on becoming a full-stack web development as well. I have passion for projects that implement and improve technologies
- I’m looking to collaborate on effective ways, provide my suggestions, so we are able to put in action the greatest applications and ideas, such as web development, gaming development or pretty much anything I can help with.
- If you want to talk about projects, looking for collaborations or simply have a conversation with me, we can communicate through discord, my discord user is "davi_starlight".
