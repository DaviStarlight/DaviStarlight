- Hi, I’m @DaviStarlight, also known as just Davi. I'm a 19 year old Brazilian developer, currently studying Computer Science
- At the moment outside of college and all by myself, I'm learning game development through the popular engine "Unreal", using the latest version, coding through C++
- I have 1 year experience at coding (basically yes, a baby coder, but passionate with programming) I believe I learned a lot through this journey so far and I feel very proud about it.. With all my humbleness, I consider myself a beginner developer, looking forward on improving my skills so I can put my creativity and ideas to fruition and codes
- I also have huge interest on becoming a full-stack web developer as well. I have passion for projects that implement and improve all kind of technologies
- I’m looking to collaborate on effective ways, provide my suggestions, so we are able to put in action the greatest applications and ideas, such as web development, game development or pretty much anything I can help with.
- If you want to talk about projects, looking for collaborations or simply have a conversation with me, we can communicate through discord. My discord user is "davi_starlight".
