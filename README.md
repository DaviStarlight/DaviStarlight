- Hi, I’m @DaviStarlight, also known as just Davi. I'm a 19 year old Brazilian developer, currently studying Computer Science
- I’m currently learning game development through the popular engine "Unreal", using the latest version, coding through C++ and I have 1 year experience at coding (basically yeah a baby, but passionate with programming).. I guess I consider myself a beginner indie developer, looking forward on improving my skills so I can put my creativity to fruition
- I also have interest on becoming a full-stack web developer as well. I have passion for projects that implement and improve all kind of technologies
- I’m looking to collaborate on effective ways, provide my suggestions, so we are able to put in action the greatest applications and ideas, such as web development, game development or pretty much anything I can help with.
- If you want to talk about projects, looking for collaborations or simply have a conversation with me, we can communicate through discord. My discord user is "davi_starlight".
