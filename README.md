- Hi, I’m @DaviStarlight, also known as just Davi. I'm a 20-year-old Brazilian developer, currently studying Computer Science.  
- Outside of college, I'm independently learning game development using the popular engine *Unreal Engine 5* (latest version), coding in C++ and Blueprints. I also develop in *Unity*, working with C#.  
- I have **two years of experience** in coding (basically, yes, a baby coder—but passionate about programming). I believe I’ve learned a lot on this journey so far, and I feel very proud of it. With all humility, I consider myself a beginner developer, eager to improve my skills so I can bring my creativity and ideas to life through code.  
- I also have a strong interest in becoming a full-stack web developer. I’m passionate about projects that implement and enhance various technologies.  
- Currently, I work at *Maxipas Saúde Ocupacional* in Curitiba, Brazil, where I’ve been for about four months. There, I develop using C#.  
- I’m looking to collaborate effectively, share my ideas, and contribute to bringing great applications and concepts to life—whether in web development, game development, or anything else I can help with.  
- If you’d like to discuss projects, collaborate, or just chat, feel free to reach out on Discord. My username is *davi_starlight*.
